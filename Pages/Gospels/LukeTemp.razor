			<BibleSection Heading="Luke Writes About the Life of Jesus"
						  Text="Most Honorable Theophilus:

								Many others have tried to give a report of the things that happened among us to complete God’s plan. What they have written agrees with what we learned from the people who saw those events from the beginning. They also served God by telling people his message. I studied it all carefully from the beginning. Then I decided to write it down for you in an organized way. I did this so that you can be sure that what you have been taught is true." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Zechariah and Elizabeth"
						  Text="During the time when Herod ruled Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He belonged to Abijah’s group. His wife came from the family of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth. Zechariah and Elizabeth were both good people who pleased God. They did everything the Lord commanded, always following his instructions completely. But they had no children. Elizabeth could not have a baby, and both of them were very old.

								Zechariah was serving as a priest before God for his group. It was his group’s time to serve. The priests always chose one priest to offer the incense, and Zechariah was the one chosen this time. So he went into the Temple of the Lord to offer the incense. There was a large crowd outside praying at the time the incense was offered.

								Then, on the right side of the incense table, an angel of the Lord came and stood before Zechariah. When he saw the angel, Zechariah was upset and very afraid. But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, don’t be afraid. Your prayer has been heard by God. Your wife Elizabeth will give birth to a baby boy, and you will name him John. You will be very happy, and many others will share your joy over his birth. He will be a great man for the Lord. He will never drink wine or beer. Even before he is born, he will be filled with the Holy Spirit.

								“John will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God. John himself will go ahead of the Lord and make people ready for his coming. He will be powerful like Elijah and will have the same spirit. He will make peace between fathers and their children. He will cause people who are not obeying God to change and start thinking the way they should.”

								Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know that what you say is true? I am an old man, and my wife is also old.”

								The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, the one who always stands ready before God. He sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news. Now, listen! You will not be able to talk until the day when these things happen. You will lose your speech because you did not believe what I told you. But everything I said will really happen.”

								Outside, the people were still waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple. Then Zechariah came outside, but he could not speak to them. So the people knew that he had seen a vision inside the Temple. He was not able to speak, so he could only make signs to the people. When his time of service was finished, he went home.

								Later, Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth became pregnant. So she did not go out of her house for five months. She said, “Look what the Lord has done for me! He decided to help me. Now people will stop thinking there is something wrong with me.”" />

			<BibleSection Heading="The Virgin Mary"
						  Text="During Elizabeth’s sixth month of pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to a virgin girl who lived in Nazareth, a town in Galilee. She was engaged to marry a man named Joseph from the family of David. Her name was Mary. The angel came to her and said, “Greetings! The Lord is with you; you are very special to him.”

								But Mary was very confused about what the angel said. She wondered, “What does this mean?”

								The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, because God is very pleased with you. Listen! You will become pregnant and have a baby boy. You will name him Jesus. He will be great. People will call him the Son of the Most High God, and the Lord God will make him king like his ancestor David. He will rule over the people of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.”

								Mary said to the angel, “How will this happen? I am still a virgin.”

								The angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High God will cover you. The baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God. And here’s something else: Your relative Elizabeth is pregnant. She is very old, but she is going to have a son. Everyone thought she could not have a baby, but she has been pregnant now for six months. God can do anything!”

								Mary said, “I am the Lord’s servant. Let this thing you have said happen to me!” Then the angel went away." />

						  Text="Mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hill country of Judea. She went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the unborn baby inside her jumped, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit.

								In a loud voice she said to Mary, “God has blessed you more than any other woman. And God has blessed the baby you will have. You are the mother of my Lord, and you have come to me! Why has something so good happened to me? When I heard your voice, the baby inside me jumped with joy. Great blessings are yours because you believed what the Lord said to you! You believed this would happen.”" />

								“I praise the Lord with all my heart.
									I am very happy because God is my Savior.
								I am not important,
									but he has shown his care for me, his lowly servant.
								From now until the end of time,
									people will remember how much God blessed me.
								Yes, the Powerful One has done great things for me.
									His name is very holy.
								He always gives mercy
									to those who worship him.
								He reached out his arm and showed his power.
									He scattered those who are proud and think great things about themselves.
								He brought down rulers from their thrones
									and raised up the humble people.
								He filled the hungry with good things,
									but he sent the rich away with nothing.
								God has helped Israel—the people he chose to serve him.
									He did not forget his promise to give us his mercy.
								He has done what he promised to our ancestors,
									to Abraham and his children forever.”

								Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then went home." />

			<BibleSection Heading="The Birth of John"
						  Text="When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a boy. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord was very good to her, and they were happy for her.

								When the baby was eight days old, they came to circumcise him. They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father’s name. But his mother said, “No, he will be named John.”

								The people said to Elizabeth, “But no one in your family has that name.” Then they made signs to his father, “What would you like to name him?”

								Zechariah asked for something to write on. Then he wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was surprised. Then Zechariah could talk again, and he began praising God. And all their neighbors were afraid. In all the hill country of Judea, people continued talking about these things. Everyone who heard about these things wondered about them. They thought, “What will this child be?” They could see that the Lord was with him." />

		<section class="Part">
			<BibleSection Heading="Zechariah Praises God"
						  Text="Then Zechariah, John’s father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the people a message from God:

								“Praise to the Lord God of Israel.
									He has come to help his people
									and has given them freedom.
								He has given us a powerful Savior
									from the family of his servant David.
								This is what he promised
									through his holy prophets long ago.
								He will save us from our enemies
									and from the power of all those who hate us.
								God said he would show mercy to our fathers,
									and he remembered his holy agreement.
								This was the promise he made to our father Abraham,
									a promise to free us from the power of our enemies,
								so that we could serve him without fear
									in a way that is holy and right for as long as we live.

								“Now you, little boy, will be called a prophet of the Most High God.
									You will go first before the Lord to prepare the way for him.
								You will make his people understand that they will be saved
									by having their sins forgiven.

								“With the loving mercy of our God,
									a new day from heaven will shine on us.
								It will bring light to those who live in darkness, in the fear of death.
									It will guide us into the way that brings peace.”

								And so the little boy John grew up and became stronger in spirit. Then he lived in areas away from other people until the time when he came out to tell God’s message to the people of Israel." />

			<BibleSection Heading="The Birth of Jesus Christ"
						  Text="It was about that same time that Augustus Caesar sent out an order to all people in the countries that were under Roman rule. The order said that everyone’s name must be put on a list. This was the first counting of all the people while Quirinius was governor of Syria. Everyone traveled to their own hometowns to have their name put on the list.

								So Joseph left Nazareth, a town in Galilee, and went to the town of Bethlehem in Judea. It was known as the town of David. Joseph went there because he was from the family of David. Joseph registered with Mary because she was engaged to marry him. (She was now pregnant.) While Joseph and Mary were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to have the baby. She gave birth to her first son. She wrapped him up well and laid him in a box where cattle are fed. She put him there because the guest room was full." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Some Shepherds Hear About Jesus"
						  Text="That night, some shepherds were out in the fields near Bethlehem watching their sheep. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining around them. The shepherds were very afraid. The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid. I have some very good news for you—news that will make everyone happy. Today your Savior was born in David’s town. He is the Messiah, the Lord. This is how you will know him: You will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box.”

								Then a huge army of angels from heaven joined the first angel, and they were all praising God, saying,

								“Praise God in heaven,
									and on earth let there be peace to the people who please him.”

								The angels left the shepherds and went back to heaven. The shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this great event the Lord has told us about.”

								So they went running and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the feeding box. When they saw the baby, they told what the angels said about this child. Everyone was surprised when they heard what the shepherds told them. Mary continued to think about these things, trying to understand them. The shepherds went back to their sheep, praising God and thanking him for everything they had seen and heard. It was just as the angel had told them.

								When the baby was eight days old, he was circumcised, and he was named Jesus. This name was given by the angel before the baby began to grow inside Mary." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Is Presented in the Temple"
						  Text="The time came for Mary and Joseph to do the things the Law of Moses taught about being made pure. They brought Jesus to Jerusalem so that they could present him to the Lord. It is written in the law of the Lord: “When a mother’s first baby is a boy, he shall be called ‘special for the Lord.’” The law of the Lord also says that people must give a sacrifice: “You must sacrifice two doves or two young pigeons.” So Joseph and Mary went to Jerusalem to do this." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Simeon Sees Jesus"
						  Text="A man named Simeon lived in Jerusalem. He was a good man who was devoted to God. He was waiting for the time when God would come to help Israel. The Holy Spirit was with him. The Holy Spirit told him that he would not die before he saw the Messiah from the Lord. The Spirit led Simeon to the Temple. So he was there when Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to do what the Jewish law said they must do. Simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked God:

								“Now, Lord, you can let me, your servant, die in peace as you said.
								I have seen with my own eyes how you will save your people.
									Now all people can see your plan.
								He is a light to show your way to the other nations.
									And he will bring honor to your people Israel.”

								Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at what Simeon said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, “Many Jews will fall and many will rise because of this boy. He will be a sign from God that some will not accept. So the secret thoughts of many will be made known. And the things that happen will be painful for you—like a sword cutting through your heart.”" />

She had lived with her husband seven years before he died and left her alone. She was now 84 years old. Anna was always at the Temple; she never left. She worshiped God by fasting and praying day and night.

								Anna was there when Joseph and Mary came to the Temple. She praised God and talked about Jesus to all those who were waiting for God to free Jerusalem." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus as a Boy"
						  Text="Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. When Jesus was twelve years old, they went to the festival as usual. When the festival was over, they went home, but Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. His parents did not know about it. They traveled for a whole day thinking that Jesus was with them in the group. They began looking for him among their family and close friends, but they did not find him. So they went back to Jerusalem to look for him there.

								After three days they found him. Jesus was sitting in the Temple area with the religious teachers, listening and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and wise answers. When his parents saw him, they wondered how this was possible. And his mother said, “Son, why did you do this to us? Your father and I were very worried about you. We have been looking for you.”

								Jesus said to them, “Why did you have to look for me? You should have known that I must be where my Father’s work is.” But they did not understand the meaning of what he said to them.

								Jesus went with them to Nazareth and obeyed them. His mother was still thinking about all these things. As Jesus grew taller, he continued to grow in wisdom. God was pleased with him and so were the people who knew him." />

			<BibleSection Heading="John Prepares the Way for Jesus"
						  Text="It was the 15th year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar. These men were under Caesar:

								Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea;

								Herod, the ruler of Galilee;

								Philip, Herod’s brother, the ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis;

								Lysanias, the ruler of Abilene.

								Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. During this time, John, the son of Zechariah, was living in the desert, and he received a message from God. So he went through the whole area around the Jordan River and told the people God’s message. He told them to be baptized to show that they wanted to change their lives, and then their sins would be forgiven. This is like the words written in the book of Isaiah the prophet:

								“There is someone shouting in the desert:
								‘Prepare the way for the Lord.
									Make the road straight for him.
								Every valley will be filled,
									and every mountain and hill will be made flat.
								Crooked roads will be made straight,
									and rough roads will be made smooth.
								Then everyone will see
									how God will save his people!’”

								Crowds of people came to be baptized by John. But he said to them, “You are all snakes! Who warned you to run from God’s judgment that is coming? Change your hearts! And show by your lives that you have changed. I know what you are about to say—‘but Abraham is our father!’ That means nothing. I tell you that God can make children for Abraham from these rocks! The ax is now ready to cut down the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”

								The people asked John, “What should we do?”

								He answered, “If you have two shirts, share with someone who does not have one. If you have food, share that too.”

								Even the tax collectors came to John. They wanted to be baptized. They said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”

								He told them, “Don’t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to collect.”

								The soldiers asked him, “What about us? What should we do?”

								He said to them, “Don’t use force or lies to make people give you money. Be happy with the pay you get.”

								Everyone was hoping for the Messiah to come, and they wondered about John. They thought, “Maybe he is the Messiah.”

								John’s answer to this was, “I baptize you in water, but there is someone coming later who is able to do more than I can. I am not good enough to be the slave who unties his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He will come ready to clean the grain. He will separate the good grain from the straw, and he will put the good part into his barn. Then he will burn the useless part with a fire that cannot be stopped.” John said many other things like this to encourage the people to change, and he told them the Good News.

								How John’s Work Later Ended
								John criticized Herod the ruler for what he had done with Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, as well as for all the other bad things he had done. So Herod added another bad thing to all his other wrongs: He put John in jail." />

								Jesus answered, “The Scriptures say,

								‘It is not just bread that keeps people alive.’”

								Then the devil took Jesus and in a moment of time showed him all the kingdoms of the world. The devil said to him, “I will make you king over all these places.

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Goes to His Hometown"
						  Text="Jesus traveled to Nazareth, the town where he grew up. On the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue as he always did. He stood up to read. The book of Isaiah the prophet was given to him. He opened the book and found the place where this is written:

								“The Spirit of the Lord is on me.
									He has chosen me to tell good news to the poor.
								He sent me to tell prisoners that they are free
									and to tell the blind that they can see again.
								He sent me to free those who have been treated badly
									and to announce that the time has come for the Lord to show his kindness.”

								Jesus closed the book, gave it back to the helper, and sat down. As everyone in the synagogue watched him closely, he began to speak to them. He said, “While you heard me reading these words just now, they were coming true!”

								Everyone there said good things about Jesus. They were amazed to hear him speak such wonderful words. They said, “How is this possible? Isn’t he Joseph’s son?”

								Jesus said to them, “I know you will tell me the old saying: ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ You want to say, ‘We heard about the things you did in Capernaum. Do those same things here in your own hometown!’” Then he said, “The truth is, a prophet is not accepted in his own hometown.

								“During the time of Elijah it did not rain in Israel for three and a half years. There was no food anywhere in the whole country. There were many widows in Israel during that time. But the fact is, Elijah was sent to none of those widows in Israel. He was sent only to a widow in Zarephath, a town in Sidon.

								“And there were many people with leprosy living in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha. But none of them were healed; the only one was Naaman. And he was from the country of Syria, not Israel.”

								When the people in the synagogue heard this, they were very angry. They got up and forced Jesus to go out of town. Their town was built on a hill. They took Jesus to the edge of the hill to throw him off. But he walked through the middle of the crowd and went away." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Chooses Some Followers"
						  Text="As Jesus stood beside Lake Galilee, a crowd of people pushed to get closer to him and to hear the teachings of God. Jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake. The fishermen were washing their nets. Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon. He asked Simon to push off a little from the shore. Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people on the shore.

When Jesus finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Take the boat into the deep water. If all of you will put your nets into the water, you will catch some fish.”

Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night trying to catch fish and caught nothing. But you say I should put the nets into the water, so I will.” The fishermen put their nets into the water. Their nets were filled with so many fish that they began to break. They called to their friends in the other boat to come and help them. The friends came, and both boats were filled so full of fish that they were almost sinking.

The fishermen were all amazed at the many fish they caught. When Simon Peter saw this, he bowed down before Jesus and said, “Go away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man!” James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were amazed too. (James and John worked together with Simon.)

Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on your work will be to bring in people, not fish!”

The men brought their boats to the shore. They left everything and followed Jesus." />

But go and let the priest look at you. And offer a gift to God for your healing as Moses commanded. This will show people that you are healed.”

But the news about Jesus spread more and more. Many people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. Jesus often went away to other places to be alone so that he could pray." />

						  Text="One day Jesus was teaching the people. The Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there too. They had come from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The Lord was giving Jesus the power to heal people. There was a man who was paralyzed, and some other men were carrying him on a mat. They tried to bring him and put him down before Jesus. But there were so many people that they could not find a way to Jesus. So they went up on the roof and lowered the crippled man down through a hole in the ceiling. They lowered the mat into the room so that the crippled man was lying before Jesus. Jesus saw how much faith they had and said to the sick man, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”

The Jewish teachers of the law and the Pharisees thought to themselves, “Who is this man who dares to say such things? What an insult to God! No one but God can forgive sins.”

But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why do you have these questions in your minds? The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ There’s no proof that it really happened. But what if I say to the man, ‘Stand up and walk’? Then you will be able to see that I really have this power.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, stand up! Take your mat and go home!”

The man immediately stood up in front of everyone. He picked up his mat and walked home, praising God. Everyone was completely amazed and began to praise God. They were filled with great respect for God’s power. They said, “Today we saw amazing things!”" />

Then Levi gave a big dinner at his house for Jesus. At the table there were many tax collectors and some other people too. But the Pharisees and those who taught the law for the Pharisees began to complain to the followers of Jesus, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other sinners?”

Jesus answered them, “It is the sick people who need a doctor, not those who are healthy. I have not come to ask good people to change. I have come to ask sinners to change the way they live.”" />

Jesus said to them, “At a wedding you can’t ask the friends of the bridegroom to be sad and fast while he is still with them. But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then his friends will fast.”

Jesus told them this story: “No one takes cloth off a new coat to cover a hole in an old coat. That would ruin the new coat, and the cloth from the new coat would not be the same as the old cloth. Also, no one ever pours new wine into old wineskins. The new wine would break them. The wine would spill out, and the wineskins would be ruined. You always put new wine into new wineskins. No one who drinks old wine wants new wine. They say, ‘The old wine is just fine.’”" />

Jesus answered, “You have read about what David did when he and the people with him were hungry. David went into God’s house. He took the bread that was offered to God and ate it. And he gave some of the bread to the people with him. This was against the Law of Moses, which says that only the priests can eat that bread.” Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, “The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath day.”" />

The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely. They were waiting to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day. They wanted to see him do something wrong so that they could accuse him. But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to the man with the crippled hand, “Get up and stand here where everyone can see.” The man got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is the right thing to do on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to destroy one?”

Jesus looked around at all of them and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it was healed. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law got so mad they couldn’t think straight. They talked to each other about what they could do to Jesus." />

Also, there were many people from all around Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast cities of Tyre and Sidon. They all came to hear Jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses. He healed the people who were troubled by evil spirits. Everyone was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him. Jesus healed them all.

Jesus looked at his followers and said,

“Great blessings belong to you who are poor.
    God’s kingdom belongs to you.
Great blessings belong to you who are hungry now.
    You will be filled.
Great blessings belong to you who are crying now.
    You will be happy and laughing.

“People will hate you because you belong to the Son of Man. They will make you leave their group. They will insult you. They will think it is wrong even to say your name. When these things happen, know that great blessings belong to you. You can be happy then and jump for joy, because you have a great reward in heaven. The ancestors of those people did the same things to the prophets.

“But how bad it will be for you rich people,
    because you had your easy life.
How bad it will be for you people who are full now,
    because you will be hungry.
How bad it will be for you people who are laughing now,
    because you will be sad and cry.

Pray for the people who are mean to you. If someone hits you on the side of your face, let them hit the other side too. If someone takes your coat, don’t stop them from taking your shirt too. Give to everyone who asks you for something. When someone takes something that is yours, don’t ask for it back. Do for others what you want them to do for you.

“If you love only those who love you, should you get any special praise for doing that? No, even sinners love those who love them! If you do good only to those who do good to you, should you get any special praise for doing that? No, even sinners do that! If you lend things to people, always expecting to get something back, should you get any special praise for that? No, even sinners lend to other sinners so that they can get back the same amount!

“I’m telling you to love your enemies and do good to them. Lend to people without expecting to get anything back. If you do this, you will have a great reward. You will be children of the Most High God. Yes, because God is good even to the people who are full of sin and not thankful. Give love and mercy the same as your Father gives love and mercy." />

You will be given much. It will be poured into your hands—more than you can hold. You will be given so much that it will spill into your lap. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you.”

Jesus told them this story: “Can a blind man lead another blind man? No. Both of them will fall into a ditch. Students are not better than their teacher. But when they have been fully taught, they will be like their teacher.

“Why do you notice the small piece of dust that is in your friend’s eye, but you don’t see the big piece of wood that is in your own eye? You say to your friend, ‘Let me get that little piece of dust out of your eye.’ Why do you say this? Can’t you see that big piece of wood in your own eye? You are a hypocrite.

						  Text="Jesus finished saying all these things to the people. Then he went into Capernaum. In Capernaum there was an army officer. He had a servant who was very sick; he was near death. The officer loved the servant very much. When he heard about Jesus, he sent some older Jewish leaders to him. He wanted the men to ask Jesus to come and save the life of his servant. The men went to Jesus. They begged Jesus to help the officer. They said, “This officer is worthy to have your help. He loves our people and he built the synagogue for us.”

So Jesus went with them. He was coming near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say, “Lord, you don’t need to do anything special for me. I am not good enough for you to come into my house. That is why I did not come to you myself. You need only to give the order, and my servant will be healed. I know this because I am a man under the authority of other men. And I have soldiers under my authority. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. And I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. And I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant obeys me.”

When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He turned to the people following him and said, “I tell you, this is the most faith I have seen anywhere, even in Israel.”

The group that was sent to Jesus went back to the house. There they found that the servant was healed." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Brings a Woman’s Son Back to Life"
						  Text="The next day Jesus and his followers went to a town called Nain. A big crowd was traveling with them. When Jesus came near the town gate, he saw some people carrying a dead body. It was the only son of a woman who was a widow. Walking with her were many other people from the town. When the Lord saw the woman, he felt very sorry for her and said, “Don’t cry.” He walked to the open coffin and touched it. The men who were carrying the coffin stopped. Jesus spoke to the dead son: “Young man, I tell you, get up!” Then the boy sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

Everyone was filled with fear. They began praising God and said, “A great prophet is here with us!” and “God is taking care of his people.”

This news about Jesus spread all over Judea and to all the other places around there." />

			<BibleSection Heading="John Sends Men to Ask Jesus a Question"
						  Text="John’s followers told him about all these things. John called for two of his followers. He sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one we heard was coming, or should we wait for someone else?”

So the men came to Jesus. They said, “John the Baptizer sent us to you with this question: ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?’”

Right then Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses and diseases. He healed those who had evil spirits and made many who were blind able to see again. Then he said to John’s followers, “Go tell John what you have seen and heard: The blind can see. The crippled can walk. People with leprosy are healed. The deaf can hear. The dead are brought back to life. And the Good News is being told to the poor. Great blessings belong to those who don’t have a problem accepting me.”

When John’s followers left, Jesus began talking to the people about John: “What did you people go out into the desert to see? Someone who is weak, like a stem of grass blowing in the wind? Really, what did you expect to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? Of course not. People who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are all in kings’ palaces. So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, John is a prophet. But I tell you, he is more than that. This Scripture was written about him:

‘Listen! I will send my messenger ahead of you.
    He will prepare the way for you.’

I tell you, no one ever born is greater than John. But even the least important person in God’s kingdom is greater than John.”

(When the people heard this, they all agreed that God’s teaching was good. Even the tax collectors agreed. These were the people who were baptized by John. But the Pharisees and experts in the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves; they did not let John baptize them.)

“What shall I say about the people of this time? What can I compare them to? What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace. One group of children calls to the other children and says,

‘We played flute music for you,
    but you did not dance;
we sang a sad song,
    but you did not cry.’

John the Baptizer came and did not eat the usual food or drink wine. And you say, ‘He has a demon inside him.’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking. And you say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine! He is a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’ But wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it.”" />

			<BibleSection Heading="Simon the Pharisee"
						  Text="One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and took a place at the table.

There was a sinful woman in that town. She knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So the woman brought some expensive perfume in an alabaster jar. She stood at Jesus’ feet, crying. Then she began to wash his feet with her tears. She dried his feet with her hair. She kissed his feet many times and rubbed them with the perfume.

When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this, he thought to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner!”

In response, Jesus said to the Pharisee, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”

Simon said, “Let me hear it, Teacher.”

Jesus said, “There were two men. Both men owed money to the same banker. One man owed him 500 silver coins. The other man owed him 50 silver coins. The men had no money, so they could not pay their debt. But the banker told the men that they did not have to pay him. Which one of those two men will love him more?”

Simon answered, “I think it would be the one who owed him the most money.”

Jesus said to him, “You are right.” Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I came into your house, you gave me no water for my feet. But she washed my feet with her tears and dried my feet with her hair. You did not greet me with a kiss, but she has been kissing my feet since I came in. You did not honor me with oil for my head, but she rubbed my feet with her sweet-smelling oil. I tell you that her many sins are forgiven. This is clear, because she showed great love. People who are forgiven only a little will love only a little.”

Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

The people sitting at the table began to think to themselves, “Who does this man think he is? How can he forgive sins?”

Jesus said to the woman, “Because you believed, you are saved from your sins. Go in peace.”" />

			<BibleSection Heading="A Story About a Farmer Sowing Seed"
						  Text="A large crowd came together. People came to Jesus from every town, and he told them this story:

“A farmer went out to sow seed. While he was scattering the seed, some of it fell beside the road. People walked on the seed, and the birds ate it all. Other seed fell on rock. It began to grow but then died because it had no water. Some other seed fell among thorny weeds. This seed grew, but later the weeds stopped the plants from growing. The rest of the seed fell on good ground. This seed grew and made 100 times more grain.”

Jesus finished the story. Then he called out, “You people who hear me, listen!”

Jesus’ followers asked him, “What does this story mean?”

He said, “You have been chosen to know the secret truths about God’s kingdom. But I use stories to speak to other people. I do this so that

‘They will look,
    but they will not see,
and they will listen,
    but they will not understand.’

Jesus Explains the Story About Seed
“This is what the story means: The seed is God’s teaching. Some people are like the seed that fell beside the path. They hear God’s teaching, but then the devil comes and causes them to stop thinking about it. This keeps them from believing it and being saved. Others are like the seed that fell on rock. That is like the people who hear God’s teaching and gladly accept it. But they don’t have deep roots. They believe for a while. But when trouble comes, they turn away from God.

“What about the seed that fell among the thorny weeds? That is like the people who hear God’s teaching, but they let the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life stop them from growing. So they never produce a crop. And what about the seed that fell on the good ground? That is like the people who hear God’s teaching with a good, honest heart. They obey it and patiently produce a good crop." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Frees a Man From Evil Spirits"
						  Text="Jesus and his followers sailed on across the lake. They sailed to the area where the Gerasene people live, across from Galilee. When Jesus got out of the boat, a man from that town came to him. This man had demons inside him. For a long time he had worn no clothes. He did not live in a house but in the caves where the dead are buried.

The demon inside the man had often seized him, and he had been put in jail with his hands and feet in chains. But he would always break the chains. The demon inside him would force him to go out to the places where no one lived. Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. When the man saw Jesus, he fell down before him, shouting loudly, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, don’t punish me!”

Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”

The man answered, “Legion.” (He said his name was “Legion” because many demons had gone into him.) The demons begged Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit. On that hill there was a big herd of pigs eating. The demons begged Jesus to allow them to go into the pigs. So he allowed them to do this. Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs. The herd of pigs ran down the hill into the lake, and all were drowned.

The men who were caring for the pigs ran away and told the story in the fields and in the town. People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man sitting there at the feet of Jesus. The man had clothes on and was in his right mind again; the demons were gone. This made the people afraid. The men who saw these things happen told the others all about how Jesus made the man well. All those who lived in the area around Gerasa asked Jesus to go away because they were afraid.

So Jesus got into the boat to go back to Galilee. The man he had healed begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, “Go back home and tell people what God did for you.”

So the man went all over town telling what Jesus had done for him." />

She was twelve years old, and she was dying. So Jairus bowed down at the feet of Jesus and begged him to come to his house.

While Jesus was going to Jairus’ house, the people crowded all around him. A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on doctors, but no doctor was able to heal her. The woman came behind Jesus and touched the bottom of his coat. At that moment, her bleeding stopped. Then Jesus said, “Who touched me?”

They all said they had not touched him. And Peter said, “Master, people are all around you, pushing against you.”

But Jesus said, “Someone touched me. I felt power go out from me.” When the woman saw that she could not hide, she came forward, shaking. She bowed down before Jesus. While everyone listened, she told why she touched him. Then she said that she was healed immediately when she touched him. Jesus said to her, “My daughter, you are made well because you believed. Go in peace.”

While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, “Your daughter has died! Don’t bother the Teacher anymore.”

Jesus heard this and said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid! Just believe and your daughter will be well.”

Jesus went to the house. He let only Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother go inside with him. Everyone was crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead. But Jesus said, “Don’t cry. She is not dead. She is only sleeping.”

The people laughed at him, because they knew that the girl was dead. But Jesus held her hand and called to her, “Little girl, stand up!” Her spirit came back into her, and she stood up immediately. Jesus said, “Give her something to eat.” The girl’s parents were amazed. He told them not to tell anyone about what happened." />

Jesus said to his followers, “Tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people.”

So the followers did this and everyone sat down. Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish. He looked up into the sky and thanked God for the food.

They also saw the two men who were standing with him. When Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said, “Master, it is good that we are here. We will put three tents here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)

While Peter was saying these things, a cloud came all around them. Peter, John, and James were afraid when the cloud covered them. A voice came from the cloud and said, “This is my Son. He is the one I have chosen. Obey him.”

When the voice stopped, only Jesus was there. Peter, John, and James said nothing. And for a long time after that, they told no one about what they had seen." />

Ask him to send more workers to help bring in his harvest.

Before you go into a house, say, ‘Peace be with this home.’ If the people living there love peace, your blessing of peace will stay with them. But if not, your blessing of peace will come back to you. Stay in the peace-loving house. Eat and drink what the people there give you. A worker should be given his pay. Don’t leave that house to stay in another house.

“If you go into a town and the people welcome you, eat the food they give you. Heal the sick people who live there, and tell them, ‘God’s kingdom is now very near you!’

“But if you go into a town and the people don’t welcome you, then go out into the streets of that town and say, ‘Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you.

The man answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.’ Also, ‘Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself.’”

Jesus said, “Your answer is right. Do this and you will have eternal life.”

But the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right. So he said to Jesus, “But who is my neighbor?”

To answer this question, Jesus said, “A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Some robbers surrounded him, tore off his clothes, and beat him. Then they left him lying there on the ground almost dead.

“It happened that a Jewish priest was going down that road. When he saw the man, he did not stop to help him. He walked away. Next, a Levite came near. He saw the hurt man, but he went around him. He would not stop to help him either. He just walked away.

“Then a Samaritan man traveled down that road. He came to the place where the hurt man was lying. He saw the man and felt very sorry for him. The Samaritan went to him and poured olive oil and wine on his wounds. Then he covered the man’s wounds with cloth. The Samaritan had a donkey. He put the hurt man on his donkey, and he took him to an inn. There he cared for him. The next day, the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the man who worked at the inn. He said, ‘Take care of this hurt man. If you spend more money on him, I will pay it back to you when I come again.’”

Then Jesus said, “Which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers?”

But you yourselves don’t even try to follow any of those rules. It will be bad for you, because you build tombs for the prophets. But these are the same prophets your ancestors killed! And now you show all people that you agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you build tombs for the prophets! This is why God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send prophets and apostles to them. Some of my prophets and apostles will be killed by evil men. Others will be treated badly.’

“So you people who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world. You will be punished for the killing of Abel.

The synagogue leader was angry because Jesus healed on the Sabbath day. He said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come to be healed on one of those days. Don’t come for healing on the Sabbath day.”

The Lord answered, “You people are hypocrites! All of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day—even on the Sabbath day. This woman that I healed is a true descendant of Abraham. But Satan has held her for 18 years. Surely it is not wrong for her to be made free from her sickness on a Sabbath day!” When Jesus said this, all those who were criticizing him felt ashamed of themselves. And all the people were happy for the wonderful things he was doing." />

If a man locks the door of his house, you can stand outside and knock on the door, but he won’t open it. You can say, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ But he will answer, ‘I don’t know you.

You are a good servant. I see that I can trust you with small things. So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities.’

“The second servant said, ‘Sir, with your one bag of money I earned five bags.’ The king said to this servant, ‘You can rule over five cities.’

“Then another servant came in and said to the king, ‘Sir, here is your bag of money. I wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it. I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You even take money that you didn’t earn and gather food that you didn’t grow.’

“Then the king said to him, ‘What a bad servant you are! I will use your own words to condemn you. You said that I am a hard man. You said that I even take money that I didn’t earn and gather food that I didn’t grow. If that is true, you should have put my money in the bank. Then, when I came back, my money would have earned some interest.’ Then the king said to the men who were watching, ‘Take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money.’

“The men said to the king, ‘But sir, that servant already has ten bags of money.’

“The king said, ‘People who use what they have will get more. But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them. Now where are my enemies? Where are the people who did not want me to be king? Bring my enemies here and kill them. I will watch them die.’”" />

He sent out two of his followers. He said, “Go into the town you can see there. When you enter the town, you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it, and bring it here to me. If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey, you should say, ‘The Master needs it.’”

The two followers went into town. They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them. They untied it, but its owners came out. They said to the followers, “Why are you untying our donkey?”

The followers answered, “The Master needs it.” So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus. They put their coats on its back. Then they put Jesus on the donkey. He rode along the road toward Jerusalem. The followers spread their coats on the road before him.

Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem. He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives. The whole group of followers was happy. They were very excited and praised God. They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen. They said,

“‘Welcome! God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord.’

Peace in heaven and glory to God!”

Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your followers not to say these things.”

Jesus answered, “I will ask you a question too. Tell me: When John baptized people, did his authority come from God or was it only from other people?”

The priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish leaders all talked about this. They said to each other, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ then he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe John?’ But if we say that John’s baptism was from someone else, the people will stone us to death. They all believe that John was a prophet.” So they answered, “We don’t know the answer.”

So the man sent a servant to those farmers so that they would give him his share of the grapes. But they beat the servant and sent him away with nothing. So the man sent another servant. They beat this servant too and showed no respect for him. They sent the servant away with nothing. So the man sent a third servant to the farmers. They hurt this servant badly and threw him out.

“The owner of the vineyard said, ‘What will I do now? I will send my son. I love my son very much. Maybe the farmers will respect my son.’ When the farmers saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the owner’s son. This vineyard will be his. If we kill him, it will be ours.’ So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him.

“What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those farmers. Then he will lease the land to some other farmers.”

When the people heard this story, they said, “This should never happen!” But Jesus looked into their eyes and said, “Then what does this verse mean:

‘The stone that the builders refused to accept
    became the cornerstone’?

Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on you, it will crush you!”

When the teachers of the law and the leading priests heard this story, they knew it was about them. So they wanted to arrest Jesus right then, but they were afraid of what the people would do." />

It doesn’t matter who is listening—you teach the same to all people. You always teach the truth about God’s way. Tell us, is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”

But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him. He said to them, “Show me a silver coin. Whose name and picture are on it?”

They said, “Caesar’s.”

He said to them, “Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.”

One time there were seven brothers. The first brother married a woman but died. He had no children. Then the second brother married the woman, and he died. And the third brother married the woman, and he died. The same thing happened with all the other brothers. They all died and had no children. The woman was the last to die. But all seven brothers married her. So when people rise from death, whose wife will this woman be?”

Jesus said to the Sadducees, “On earth, people marry each other. Some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life. In that life they will not marry. In that life people are like angels and cannot die. They are children of God, because they have been raised from death. Moses clearly showed that people are raised from death. When Moses wrote about the burning bush, he said that the Lord is ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ So they were not still dead, because he is the God only of living people. Yes, to God they are all still living.”

			<BibleSection Heading="News That Jesus Has Risen From Death"
						  Text="Very early Sunday morning, the women came to the tomb where Jesus’ body was laid. They brought the sweet-smelling spices they had prepared. They saw that the heavy stone that covered the entrance had been rolled away. They went in, but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. They did not understand this. While they were wondering about it, two men in shining clothes stood beside them. The women were very afraid. They bowed down with their faces to the ground. The men said to them, “Why are you looking for a living person here? This is a place for dead people. Jesus is not here. He has risen from death. Do you remember what he said in Galilee? He said the Son of Man must be handed over to the control of sinful men, be killed on a cross, and rise from death on the third day.” Then the women remembered what Jesus had said.

The women left the tomb and went to the eleven apostles and the other followers. They told them everything that happened at the tomb. These women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary, the mother of James, and some others. They told the apostles everything that happened. But the apostles did not believe what they said. It sounded like nonsense. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb to see. He looked in, but he saw only the cloth that Jesus’ body had been wrapped in. It was just lying there. Peter went away to be alone, wondering what had happened." />

			<BibleSection Heading="On The Road to Emmaus"
						  Text="That same day two of Jesus’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus. It is about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking about everything that had happened. While they were talking, discussing these things, Jesus himself came near and walked with them. (But the two men were not allowed to recognize Jesus.) He asked them, “What’s this I hear you discussing with each other as you walk?”

The two men stopped, their faces looking very sad. The one named Cleopas said, “You must be the only person in Jerusalem who doesn’t know what has just happened there.”

Jesus said, “What are you talking about?”

They said, “It’s about Jesus, the one from Nazareth. To God and to all the people he was a great prophet. He said and did many powerful things. But our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be judged and killed. They nailed him to a cross. We were hoping that he would be the one to free Israel. But then all this happened.

“And now something else: It has been three days since he was killed, but today some of our women told us an amazing thing. Early this morning they went to the tomb where the body of Jesus was laid. But they did not find his body there. They came and told us they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels told them Jesus was alive! So some of our group went to the tomb too. It was just as the women said. They saw the tomb, but they did not see Jesus.”

Then Jesus said to the two men, “You are foolish and slow to realize what is true. You should believe everything the prophets said. The prophets said the Messiah must suffer these things before he begins his time of glory.” Then he began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures. He started with the books of Moses and then he talked about what the prophets had said about him.

They came near the town of Emmaus, and Jesus acted as if he did not plan to stop there. But they wanted him to stay. They begged him, “Stay with us. It’s almost night. There’s hardly any daylight left.” So he went in to stay with them.

Joining them at the supper table, Jesus took some bread and gave thanks. Then he broke some off and gave it to them. Just then the men were allowed to recognize him. But when they saw who he was, he disappeared. They said to each other, “When he talked to us on the road, it felt like a fire burning in us. How exciting it was when he explained to us the true meaning of the Scriptures!”

So the two men got up then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the followers of Jesus meeting together. The eleven apostles and the people with them said, “The Lord really has risen from death! He appeared to Simon.”

Then the two men told what had happened on the road. They talked about how they recognized Jesus when he shared the bread with them." />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Appears to His Followers"
						  Text="While the two men were saying these things to the other followers, Jesus himself came and stood among them. He said to them, “Peace be with you.”

This surprised the followers. They were afraid. They thought they were seeing a ghost. But Jesus said, “Why are you troubled? Why do you doubt what you see? Look at my hands and my feet. It’s really me. Touch me. You can see that I have a living body; a ghost does not have a body like this.”

After Jesus told them this, he showed them his hands and his feet. The followers were amazed and very, very happy to see that Jesus was alive. They still could not believe what they saw. He said to them, “Do you have any food here?” They gave him a piece of cooked fish. While the followers watched, he took the fish and ate it.

Jesus said to them, “Remember when I was with you before? I said that everything written about me must happen—everything written in the Law of Moses, the books of the prophets, and the Psalms.”

Then Jesus helped the followers understand these Scriptures about him. Jesus said to them, “It is written that the Messiah would be killed and rise from death on the third day. You saw these things happen—you are witnesses. You must go and tell people that they must change and turn to God, which will bring them his forgiveness. You must start from Jerusalem and tell this message in my name to the people of all nations. Remember that I will send you the one my Father promised. Stay in the city until you are given that power from heaven.”" />

			<BibleSection Heading="Jesus Goes Back to Heaven"
						  Text="Jesus led his followers out of Jerusalem almost to Bethany. He raised his hands and blessed his followers. While he was blessing them, he was separated from them and carried into heaven. They worshiped him and went back to Jerusalem very happy. They stayed at the Temple all the time, praising God." />
