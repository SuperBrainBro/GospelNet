<BibleSection Heading="What is this?" Text="
This website was created in order to help me learn ASP.NET + Blazor. Its purpose is to provide a place for easy navigation and reading of the GOSPEL without any funny business. No bloat, pure Bible. Only NIV translation, I'm not making a political statement about whats the most 'correct' bible translation. The 'github-net.xyz' domain only costed me $1.18 from namecheap.com. I could have gotten something from Freenom but I don't trust Freenom anymore. This website has extremely modular code, with customizability in mind. I also designed it around PWA, so you can use this entire website offline (client sided) in its own window (While on desktop). The cool black fade effect is not available on mobile because it causes problems when you scroll. I had the cool idea to make games on here and a chat so I will definitely do that. This website might low key be VJSDGames.com 2.0.
